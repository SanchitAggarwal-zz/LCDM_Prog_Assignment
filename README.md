LCDM_Prog_Assignment
====================

The sample programming task is to read in an astronomy image, find the center of the light distribution, compute the second order moments of the light distribution, use these to compute the principal axes of the the light distribution (i.e, ellipticity), and finally to display the image with the center pixel marked and the principal axis of the image indicated.
Following is the output of the code:
